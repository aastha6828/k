## Understanding the 5 Levels of Leadership

John Maxwell's "5 Levels of Leadership" is a widely recognized framework that outlines the different stages a leader progresses through. Understanding these levels allows individuals to assess their current leadership capacity and identify areas for growth. The levels are:

*   **Level 1: Position.** People follow because they *have* to. This is the entry-level of leadership, often based on authority and title.
*   **Level 2: Permission.** People follow because they *want* to. This level is built on relationships and trust.
*   **Level 3: Production.** People follow because of what you have *done* for the organization. This level demonstrates results and competence.
*   **Level 4: People Development.** People follow because of what you have *done* for them. This level focuses on mentoring and empowering others.
*   **Level 5: Pinnacle.** People follow because of *who you are* and what you represent. This is the highest level of leadership, characterized by respect and influence.
