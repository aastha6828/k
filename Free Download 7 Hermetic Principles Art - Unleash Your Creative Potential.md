## Understanding the 7 Hermetic Principles

The 7 Hermetic Principles, rooted in the teachings of Hermes Trismegistus, provide a framework for understanding reality. They are:

*   **The Principle of Mentalism:** "The All is Mind; The Universe is Mental." This principle states that everything is a manifestation of mind.
*   **The Principle of Correspondence:** "As above, so below; as below, so above." This suggests a universal harmony and connection between different planes of existence.
*   **The Principle of Vibration:** "Nothing rests; everything moves; everything vibrates." Everything is in constant motion and vibrating at different frequencies.
*   **The Principle of Polarity:** "Everything is dual; everything has poles; everything has its pair of opposites; like and unlike are the same; opposites are identical in nature, but different in degree; extremes meet; all truths are but half-truths; all paradoxes may be reconciled."
*   **The Principle of Rhythm:** "Everything flows, out and in; everything has its tides; all things rise and fall; the pendulum-swing manifests in everything; the measure of the swing to the right is the measure of the swing to the left; rhythm compensates."
*   **The Principle of Cause and Effect:** "Every cause has its effect; every effect has its cause; everything happens according to law; chance is but a name for law not recognized; there are many planes of causation, but nothing escapes the law."
*   **The Principle of Gender:** "Gender is in everything; everything has its masculine and feminine principles; Gender manifests on all planes."
