## Why Build a 2D Graphics Engine with C++?

C++ offers unparalleled control and performance, making it ideal for crafting robust and efficient graphics engines. While pre-built engines like Unity or GameMaker are popular, understanding the underlying principles allows for greater customization and optimization. This is especially crucial when working on projects with specific performance requirements or unique visual styles. Learning to build your own 2D graphics engine provides a deep understanding of:

*   **Low-level graphics programming:** Direct interaction with the graphics API.
*   **Memory management:** Efficiently handling textures, sprites, and other graphical assets.
*   **Optimization techniques:** Achieving smooth frame rates and responsiveness.
*   **Customization capabilities:** Tailoring the engine to specific project needs.
*   **Cross-platform development:** C++'s portability enables targeting various operating systems.

This particular free course focuses on giving you the building blocks and practical experience to **design and implement your own 2D graphics engine**.

## What You’ll Learn in This Free C++ Graphics Engine Course

This course aims to equip you with the core skills and knowledge necessary to construct a functional and efficient 2D graphics engine. You'll learn through hands-on projects and practical examples. Here's a breakdown of the key modules:

*   **Refer to Additional Resources:** Supplement the course material with other online resources, such as documentation, tutorials, and blog posts. This can help you gain a deeper understanding of the concepts and explore alternative approaches.

## Essential C++ Concepts to Know Beforehand

While the course is designed to be beginner-friendly, having a basic understanding of C++ programming fundamentals will greatly enhance your learning experience. Specifically, you should be familiar with the following concepts:

*   **Variables and Data Types:** Understand the different data types in C++ (int, float, char, bool, etc.) and how to declare and use variables.
*   **Operators:** Know how to use arithmetic, relational, logical, and assignment operators.
*   **Control Flow:** Be familiar with if-else statements, loops (for, while, do-while), and switch statements.
*   **Functions:** Understand how to define and call functions, pass arguments, and return values.
*   **Arrays and Pointers:** Have a basic understanding of arrays and pointers.
*   **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):** Familiarize yourself with the concepts of classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation.
*   **Memory Management:** Know how to allocate and deallocate memory using new and delete.

If you're lacking in any of these areas, consider taking a beginner-level C++ course before starting the graphics engine course.
