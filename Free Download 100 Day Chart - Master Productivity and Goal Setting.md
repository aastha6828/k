*   **Not Tracking Progress Accurately:** Be honest with yourself about whether you're truly completing your daily tasks. Don't mark off a square unless you've actually earned it.

*   **Forgetting to Celebrate Milestones:** Acknowledge and reward yourself for your successes along the way. This will help you stay motivated and engaged.
