## Key Concepts Covered in Coding Practice Questions

Coding practice questions often cover fundamental data structures and algorithms. Understanding these concepts is crucial for solving a wide range of coding problems. Here are some of the key concepts you can expect to encounter:

*   **Data Structures:**
    *   **Arrays:** Ordered collections of elements.
    *   **Linked Lists:** Chains of nodes, where each node contains a value and a pointer to the next node.
    *   **Stacks:** Last-in, first-out (LIFO) data structures.
    *   **Queues:** First-in, first-out (FIFO) data structures.
    *   **Trees:** Hierarchical data structures with a root node and child nodes.
    *   **Graphs:** Collections of nodes and edges, representing relationships between objects.
    *   **Hash Tables:** Data structures that use a hash function to map keys to values.
*   **Algorithms:**
    *   **Sorting Algorithms:** Algorithms for arranging elements in a specific order (e.g., bubble sort, merge sort, quicksort).
    *   **Searching Algorithms:** Algorithms for finding a specific element in a collection (e.g., linear search, binary search).
    *   **Recursion:** A programming technique where a function calls itself.
    *   **Dynamic Programming:** An algorithmic technique for solving complex problems by breaking them down into smaller, overlapping subproblems.
    *   **Greedy Algorithms:** Algorithmic techniques that make the best locally optimal choice at each step.

By mastering these data structures and algorithms, you will be well-equipped to tackle a wide range of coding practice questions and develop efficient and effective solutions.
