## Why is Unreal Engine 5 Game Size a Concern?

Developing a visually impressive game using Unreal Engine 5 comes with potential drawbacks, primarily concerning the final game's size. Large game sizes can impact several areas:

*   **Download times:** Nobody wants to wait hours to download a game. Large game sizes lead to frustration and potential players abandoning the download process.
*   **Storage requirements:** Players need sufficient storage space on their devices. A bloated game size can deter players, especially those with limited storage.
*   **Performance issues:** Unoptimized assets contribute to larger game sizes and can also negatively impact the game's performance, leading to lag and a poor player experience.
*   **Distribution costs:** For developers, larger game sizes translate to increased distribution costs, particularly when using bandwidth-based distribution models.

Therefore, understanding and implementing effective **game size optimization techniques in Unreal Engine 5** is crucial for both the developer and the player.
