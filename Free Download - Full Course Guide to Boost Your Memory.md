## What is Мнемоніка (Mnemonics)?

Mnemonics are memory aids that help you organize and retain information. They work by associating new information with something familiar, such as a rhyme, image, or acronym.  This makes it easier to recall the new information when you need it. Think of it like creating a mental "hook" to hang information on.

Mnemonics are incredibly versatile and can be used to remember almost anything, from names and faces to historical dates and scientific formulas. This course dives into a variety of mnemonic techniques, providing practical exercises to help you master each one.
