## Understanding the Demand for 3-MMC and Its Current Status

3-MMC, belonging to the cathinone class of compounds, gained popularity as a research chemical due to its stimulating and euphoric effects. However, its use has raised concerns due to potential health risks and addictive properties. Consequently, several jurisdictions have implemented bans or restrictions on its sale and possession. This scarcity has led individuals to seek alternative sources and information, reflected in searches like "3 MMC for sale".

**Why is 3-MMC becoming increasingly regulated?**
