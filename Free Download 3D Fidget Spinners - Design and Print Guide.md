## Key Concepts Covered in the Course

Let's break down some crucial elements you'll learn throughout this course:

*   **CAD Software:** This is the digital workspace where you'll bring your fidget spinner ideas to life. Popular options include:
    *   **Tinkercad:** A free, browser-based program ideal for beginners. It uses a simple block-building approach.
    *   **Fusion 360:** A more powerful, professional-grade CAD software (often free for hobbyists and startups) offering more advanced features and capabilities.

*   **Slicing Software:** This program translates your 3D model into instructions that your 3D printer can understand. Common slicers include:
    *   **Cura:** A widely used, open-source slicer known for its ease of use and extensive customization options.
    *   **PrusaSlicer:** Developed by Prusa Research, this slicer offers excellent precision and a wide range of advanced features.

*   **Filament Types:** The material your fidget spinner is printed with. Common types include:
    *   **PLA (Polylactic Acid):** A biodegradable thermoplastic that is easy to print and produces good results. It's a great choice for beginners.
    *   **ABS (Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene):** A stronger, more durable plastic that is more resistant to heat. However, it can be more challenging to print than PLA.
    *   **PETG (Polyethylene Terephthalate Glycol):** A good compromise between PLA and ABS, offering good strength, durability, and ease of printing.

*   **Bearing Basics:** The heart of the fidget spinner, allowing it to spin smoothly. Different types and sizes of bearings affect performance.
